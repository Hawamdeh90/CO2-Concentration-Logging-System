# CO2-Concentration-Logging-System
Our client-server program called the CO2 Concentration Logging System was developed to assist  environmental researchers in gathering and documenting CO2 measurements. Researchers are able  to submit their data using this mechanism. Their postcode, their unique User ID, and the CO2  concentration in parts per million (ppm) are all recorded.
