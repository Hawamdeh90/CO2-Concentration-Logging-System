# CO2-Concentration-Logging-System
It is an example of a client-server program called the CO2 Concentration Logging System, which was developed to assist environmental researchers in gathering and documenting CO2 measurements. Researchers can submit their data using this mechanism. Their postcode, unique User ID, and the CO2  concentration in parts per million (ppm) are all recorded.
